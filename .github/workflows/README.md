# Workflows Directory README

Welcome to the `workflows` directory of our GitHub repository. This directory is a crucial component of our project, as it contains YAML files that define the GitHub Actions workflows we use for automation across various aspects of our project management and deployment processes. Below, you'll find detailed information about each workflow file present in this directory.

## Overview

GitHub Actions enable us to automate, customize, and execute our software development workflows right within our repository. The `workflows` directory contains the following YAML files, each tailored for specific automated processes:

- `greetings.yml`
- `static.yml`
- `label.yml`

### `greetings.yml` - Welcome and Greetings Workflow

The `greetings.yml` file defines a workflow that automatically sends a greeting message to contributors whenever they open a new issue or make their first pull request. This small touch helps in building a welcoming community around our project.

#### Key Features:

- **Welcomes new contributors** with a friendly message when they submit their first pull request.
- **Thanks users** for submitting issues, encouraging a positive community environment.

### `static.yml` - Static Content Deployment to GitHub Pages

The `static.yml` workflow is designed for deploying static content to GitHub Pages. It triggers on pushes to the main branch or can be manually run, ensuring our project's static assets are seamlessly and continuously deployed.

#### Key Features:

- **Automatic deployment** to GitHub Pages on pushes to the main branch.
- **Manual deployment option** through the GitHub Actions tab, providing flexibility for updates and maintenance.
- **Concurrency control** to manage deployment flows and ensure stability in production deployments.

### `label.yml` - Automatic Pull Request Labeling

Our `label.yml` file outlines a workflow for automatically labeling pull requests based on the paths of files that are modified. This automation aids in categorizing pull requests, streamlining the review process, and facilitating easier project management.

### `eslint-lint.yml` - Linting with ESLint

The `eslint-lint.yml` file defines a workflow that runs the ESLint linter on the JavaScript files in the repository. This workflow is triggered on pushes to the main branch and pull requests, ensuring that the JavaScript code in the repository is properly linted.

### `greet-contributors.yml` - Greet New Contributors

The `greet-contributors.yml` file defines a workflow that sends a greeting message to new contributors when they open their first pull request. This workflow is triggered on pull request events and checks if the pull request is the first one opened by the contributor.

### `auto-assign-reviewers.yml` - Automatic Reviewer Assignment

The `auto-assign-reviewers.yml` file defines a workflow that automatically assigns reviewers to pull requests based on the files modified in the pull request. This workflow is triggered on pull request events and assigns reviewers based on the paths of the modified files.

#### Key Features:

- **Automates labeling** based on file paths, simplifying the categorization of pull requests.
- **Configurable labels** via a `.github/labeler.yml` file, allowing for custom rules and label management.

## Getting Started

To make the most out of these workflows, ensure you have the following:

- **GitHub Actions enabled** on your repository.
- **Proper permissions** set for the GitHub Actions to run effectively, especially for workflows like `static.yml` that deploy to GitHub Pages.
- **A `.github/labeler.yml` file** for the `label.yml` workflow, defining your custom rules for automatic labeling.

## Contribution Guidelines

Contributions to improve these workflows are always welcome. Whether it's adding new features, fixing bugs, or improving documentation, please feel free to make changes. Ensure you follow our contribution guidelines outlined in the repository's `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.
