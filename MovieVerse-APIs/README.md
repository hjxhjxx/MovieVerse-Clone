## Overview

The `MovieVerse-APIs` directory plays a crucial role in interfacing with the web services and APIs that power the MovieVerse application. This directory contains files that help test, define, and document the API endpoints.

### api.http

This file contains HTTP requests for testing the web APIs. It is used to send requests to endpoints, allowing developers to test and debug APIs directly within an IDE like Visual Studio Code.

### http-client.env.json

A configuration file for setting up environment variables used in the `api.http` file. This might include variables like base URL, API keys, or any other common data required in HTTP requests.

### http-client.private.env.json

Similar to `http-client.env.json`, but used for storing private or sensitive information like API keys, secrets, and tokens. This file should not be checked into version control to maintain security.

### movieverse-openapi.yaml

An OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) specification file that provides a standard, language-agnostic interface to RESTful APIs. It is used to define the MovieVerse API's structure, including endpoints, operations, and parameters.

### api_test_suite.py

This file contains a test suite for the MovieVerse APIs. It uses the `requests` library to send HTTP requests to the API endpoints and validate the responses. The test suite can be run to ensure that the API is functioning as expected.

## Using these Files

To utilize these files effectively, familiarity with API testing and OpenAPI specifications is recommended. Ensure that sensitive information in `.env` files is properly secured and not exposed in public repositories.

## Customization and Adaptation

These configurations may need adjustments to align with specific API endpoints, parameters, or security requirements of the project. Review and update these files as your API evolves.
