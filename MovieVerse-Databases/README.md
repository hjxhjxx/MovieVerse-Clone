## Overview

The `MovieVerse-Database` directory is critical for managing the data structures and schemas for the MovieVerse application. It includes files for setting up relational databases (MySQL) and NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Firebase).

### movie-user.sql

A SQL script file for creating and setting up user-related tables in a MySQL database. It defines the schema for storing user data, such as profiles, preferences, and authentication details.

### movieverse_chatbot.sql

This SQL file contains the schema and data for the chatbot feature in the application. It includes tables for storing chatbot responses, user queries, and interaction logs.

### movieverse_nosql_setup.js

A JavaScript file to set up and configure the NoSQL databases (Firebase, MongoDB). It contains scripts for initializing collections, defining documents, and setting up initial data or rules.

### movieverse_schema.sql

A comprehensive SQL script that defines the entire database schema for the MovieVerse application. It includes tables for movies, genres, reviews, ratings, and other related data.

### movieverse_user_management.sql

Contains SQL scripts related to user management features. This includes user roles, permissions, account settings, and other functionalities necessary for user account handling.

## Using these Files

These files are crucial for setting up the backend of the application. Ensure that you have the necessary database servers (MySQL, MongoDB, Firebase) running and accessible. Run these scripts to create and configure your databases according to the project's requirements.

## Customization and Adaptation

You may need to customize these scripts to fit the specific needs of your application. Be sure to regularly back up your databases before making any changes to these scripts.

## Contact

As mentioned, you'll need to contact us if you would like to access our databases or other back-end features. Feel free to reach out to us at [info@movie-verse.com](info@movie-verse.com). We look forward to collaborating with you!
